                <h6 class="display-2">OnePlus 11R</h6>
                <p>2022 was a strange year for OnePlus' flagship smartphone lineup. We just had one proper flagship in the beginning of the year, the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G (Review), but no refresh after it. There was no OnePlus 10, but the OnePlus 10T 5G (Review) came later with a faster SoC and with most of the frills of the Pro stripped away, including the iconic Alert slider. Now, the company has just showcased its initial slate of products for 2023, which includes the OnePlus 11R 5G and the OnePlus 11 5G. Both smartphones feature a tweaked design with the Alert slider in place, and upgraded specs.The OnePlus 11 5G price starts at Rs. 56,999 in India and the base variant comes with 8GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 128GB of UFS 4.0 storage. The second variant doubles everything, offering 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for Rs. 61,999. This is pretty aggressive pricing considering the 11 5G is on par with the 10 Pro 5G in terms of specs, and even exceeds it in some areas.</p>
               <h4> OnePlus 11 5G design</h4>
    The OnePlus 11 5G looks very similar to the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G from last year and that's not a bad thing. The most obvious change is that the rear camera module is now circular instead of square. There's also also some added texture under the camera module's glass that's visible when viewed at certain angles. The Hasselblad logo is now placed horizontally, between the four camera lenses instead of to one side.

                    The rest of the dimensions, build quality, and in-hand feel are pretty much the same as those of the 10 Pro 5G. The OnePlus 11 5G is ever so slightly slimmer at 8.53mm, but it has gained a bit more weight at 205g. The curved sides of the aluminium frame make it comfortable to carry this phone around but it can be very slippery when held in one hand due to the smooth finish of the back panel, which has Corning Gorilla Glass 5. The rubber case included in the box does help. OnePlus sent us the Titan Black colour this time, but it's also available in Eternal Green, similar to the 10 Pro 5G.

                <h4>OnePlus 11 5G specifications and software</h4>
    No Android flagship is complete if it doesn't sport the latest SoC and that's exactly what you get. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC in the OnePlus 11 5G doesn't seem to be customised in any way for the phone, unlike Samsung's S23 series, but OnePlus claims that it has used a new, larger vapour cooling system that should offer better hear dissipation for sustained performance.

    The OnePlus 11 5G technically supports Wi-Fi 7, which might become available in India soon. There's also Bluetooth 5.3, support for 13 5G bands, and the usual suite of sensors and satellite navigation systems. The phone has a 5,000mAh battery, stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, an in-display fingerprint sensor (optical), and NFC.

    <p>OnePlus has overhauled all the cameras on the 11 5G, compared to the 10 Pro 5G. The main camera now uses a Sony IMX890 sensor which is slightly smaller than the one in the 10 Pro 5G, but has gained a bit more resolution (50 megapixels). The focal length has increased by 1mm but the aperture is still the same f/1.8. The ultra-wide camera gets a much-needed upgrade to a 48-megapixel Sony IMX581 sensor. It has a narrower field of view than before (115 degrees vs 150 degrees), but the sensor is now larger and it supports autofocus which means macro mode is back.</p>
